## App Description: 
- A Spam Filter classifies messages (commonly emails) to remove incoming spam. This is the technology that prevents you from seeing spam in your inbox folder as much as possible; the spam instead goes to the Spam folder. A common way to implement a spam filter is to represent all received emails as in a bag-of-words and compute the probability of a message being spam given the words that make it up. Naive Bayes with Laplace smoothing is a popular algorithm used for text classification tasks, such as spam filtering. The algorithm is based on Bayes' theorem and assumes that the features (words in the case of text classification) are conditionally independent given the class label. Despite its simplicity, Naive Bayes often performs well in practice.
